  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/background.png
    - assets/flag.png
    - assets/plat1.png
    - assets/plat2.png
    - assets/Recipes.json
    - assets/Workout.json
    - assets/Food/
    - assets/Workout/gain weight/
    - assets/Workout/improve endurance/
    - assets/Workout/lose weight/
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: PoetsenOne
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/PoetsenOne-Regular.ttf
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-Bold.ttf  
    - family: Medium
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Poppins-Medium.ttf 
        
 
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
